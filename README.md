#Python Iteration

This repo is published in conjunction with my talk entitled
[Efficient Iteration in Python](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bC1IUY3BQcWHzRVblpmSBjYpHkcdhT9EUkcxNo2UUgY/edit?usp=sharing) which I presented
at Code & Supply on Wednesday, July 27th, 2016.

##Setup Instructions:
1. Clone this repo (The `--recursive` is necessary since my advanced examples depend on a dataset housed in another repo):
   
   `$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cheesesashimi/python-iteration.git`
   
2. Create and activate a new virtual env:

   `$ virtualenv venv && source ./venv/bin/activate`

3. Install any required packages:
   
   `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. Have fun! Also, I accept pull requests :).
